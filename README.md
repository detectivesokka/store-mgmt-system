# store-mgmt-system
A Java-Swing based store management system that helps SME business owners manage their stores. 


Here is the project critiria - 

###Develop an application around a single business use case such as a University Management Portal that involves 4 departments, 8 roles and an in-depth class design for each department covering maximum number of necessary factors

There are 4 Enterprises, 6 Organziations and 8 Roles in this store management application system. Please check the [class diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NjIwWlqflMTbNfZIKSAUuTNGmDdMz6b7/view?usp=sharing) for reference

I have also used DB4O as the database and JFreeChart for displaying charts.
